# DecreasedFallDamage 1.1.0
A Valheim mod which modifies fall damage in 1 or a combination of 3 ways:
 - 1: A modified fallDamage multiplier from 0 - 100 (100 is the default)
 - 2: A minimum height to incur fall damage value
 - 3: Based off Jump skill

## :: REQUIREMENTS ::
• BepInEx 5.4.8.0 - valheim

## :: FEATURES ::
• Configurable fallDamage modifier from 0% - 100%
• Configurable minFallHeight modifier from 1 - 100

## *** Note ***
The player is about 0.8 units tall. The game's default
fall height is 4. If you set this to 1, you will take
damage after a normal flat grounded jump.
