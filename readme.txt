Decreased Fall Damage - 1.2.0
by Bryan Ritchie @ RitchMods

::  REQUIREMENTS  ::
• BepInEx 5.4.8.0 - valheim

::  FEATURES  ::
• Fall Damage dependent upon Jump Skill
• Configurable fallDamage modifier from 0% - 100% 
• Configurable minFallHeight modifier from 1 - 100

:: RELEASE NOTES ::
Version 1.2.0:
 • Added a skillMode configuration entry to allow fall damage
   to rely on the Player's jump skill (more realistic)
 • Added logging output to BepInEx window to report % of damage reduction
 • Bug fix in the IL patch

Version 1.1.0:
 • Added a configuration entry to adjust the minimum fall height
   before taking fall damage
  
:: NOTES ::
 • The player is about 0.8 units tall. The game's default 
   fall height is 4. If you set this to the minimum, 
   you will take damage after a normal flat grounded jump.

 • Version 1.2.0 is by default in Skill Mode
